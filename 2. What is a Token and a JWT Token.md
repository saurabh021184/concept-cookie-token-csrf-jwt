# while cookies are primarily used for storing information on the client side (browser), tokens (including CSRF tokens) are used for secure authentication and authorization between the client and the server. Each serves a distinct purpose in web development, contributing to the overall security and functionality of web applications.
## Tokens: Used for stateless authentication and authorization in modern web applications.
### Tokens:
#### Definition: Strings of characters used to identify or authenticate users and sessions.
#### Types:
- Authentication Tokens: Such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) used to verify a user's identity.
- Access Tokens: Used to access resources in APIs.
- Purpose: Provide a stateless way to handle authentication and authorization. They can be stored in local storage, session storage, or cookies.
- Usage: Commonly used in modern web applications, especially in single-page applications (SPAs) and APIs for user authentication and authorization.

# Stateless Authentication and Authorization in Modern Web Applications

## What is Stateless Authentication?

Stateless authentication refers to a method where the server does not store any session information about the user. Instead, all the necessary information to authenticate and authorize a user is contained within a token that is sent with each request. This token is usually a JSON Web Token (JWT).

## How it Works

1. **User Logs In**:
   - The user provides their credentials (username and password) to the server.
   - The server verifies the credentials.
   - If valid, the server generates a JWT that includes user information and possibly permissions/roles, and sends it back to the client.

2. **Client Stores the Token**:
   - The client (typically a web browser or mobile app) stores this token, usually in local storage or a cookie.

3. **User Makes Requests**:
   - For each subsequent request to the server, the client includes the token in the HTTP headers (commonly the `Authorization` header with a Bearer scheme).

4. **Server Verifies the Token**:
   - The server verifies the token’s signature to ensure it’s valid and has not been tampered with.
   - The server extracts user information from the token and processes the request based on the user’s identity and permissions.

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Since the server does not need to store session information, it can easily scale horizontally (i.e., add more servers).
- **Decoupling**: The authentication system is decoupled from the application logic, making it easier to manage.
- **Performance**: Reduces server memory usage as no session data is stored.

## Does the Backend Server Store Token Details?

In stateless authentication, the backend server does not store any token details. The token itself carries all the information needed for authentication and authorization, and the server only verifies the token’s integrity and validity. 

## Stateless Authorization

Authorization in this context means that the token contains the necessary claims (information) that specify what the user is allowed to do. This might include user roles, permissions, or specific resources the user can access.

## Understanding with JWT

A JSON Web Token typically has three parts:

1. **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, such as the type of token and the hashing algorithm used.
2. **Payload**: Contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
3. **Signature**: Used to verify the token’s integrity and authenticity.

- **Header**: `{"alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT"}`
- **Payload**: `{"userId": 1, "role": "admin", "iat": 1516239022}`
- **Signature**: The hash of the header and payload, combined with a secret key.

## Conclusion

Stateless authentication and authorization provide a streamlined and scalable approach for handling user sessions. The server does not store any session data, and all necessary information is encoded within the token, which is verified with each request. This approach offers significant advantages in terms of scalability and decoupling of authentication logic from the application’s core functionality.
